      <h3>How to Help</h3>
      <p>
        Wars leave behind ruins and shattered lives. But from the ashes, we can rebuild and restore. However, those affected by war cannot do it alone. 
        They need support from people like you. At "How to Help", we offer various avenues through which you can make a difference. 
        From donations that will go directly to relief efforts, volunteering opportunities in war-torn areas, to raising awareness in your community about the realities of war. Every little bit helps. 
        Your contribution, no matter how small, can bring warmth to a child freezing in a makeshift tent, bring medical aid to the injured, or help rebuild a school where education can flourish once again. 
        Stand with us, extend your hand, and together, let's make a world of difference to those affected by war.
